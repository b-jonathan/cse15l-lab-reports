## Step 4
Keys pressed: <up> <enter>
The ssh bjonathan@ieng6.ucsd.edu command was the first command in the search history


## Step 5
Keys pressed: g i t <space> c l o n e <Ctrl + v> <enter>
Manually typed git clone and then copy pasted the github ssh URL that was forked.

## Step 6
Keys pressed: c d l <tab> <enter> l s <enter> b a s h t <tab> <enter>
After cloning, changed directory into lab7 (autocompleted by tab) then ls'd to find the bash script that contained the testing commands. Finally, bash and typed t (autocomplted to test.sh with tab) and ran the script

## Step 7
Keys pressed: v i m <shift + l> <tab> . j <tab> <enter> <shift + down> <up> <up> <up> e c w 2 <esc> : w q
Problem with test is that there is an index1 written instead of index2. First, use vim to open the ListExamples.java (autocompleted with tabs) and then navigate with <shfit + down> and <up> to reach the line with the incorrect index. Then, use e to reach the end of the word index1 then use c w 2 to change the last character from 1 -> 2. Escape to leave change mode and finally use :wq to save the changes made.

## Step 8
Keys Pressed: <up> <up> <enter>
bash test.sh was one command above vim ListExamples.java in the search history so only needed to go up twice and enter the command.q
